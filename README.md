## Description

We began the project by building the box to which will have the arduino in it and attaching the motors, as well as wiring the connection between the Arduino and breadboard. This wiring was to set up the motors to the Arduino, the Arduino to the receptors and to the raspberry pi, then controlled by the remote. There was an issue between the wiring of the Arduino and the sensor. The issue with the wiring, we then began to construct the sensor to the motherboard and figure out the technical issues with that. After struggling with the remote and sensor we found out the sensor was in actuality broken! We then began to connect the new sensor to the remote and then to the motors. We figured out one of the motors was not working so after troubleshooting that through the wiring and testing out the voltage we were able to fix it. Now it was time to actually write code for the remote control. We were able to run the motors through the remote successfully. We then added a distance sensor to get the car to create a braking effect. Once that was all figured out we switched the IR sensor with the Raspberry Pi.
